CRiSp implements a spatial morphological method of delineation ([Forgaci, 2018](https://doi.org/10.7480/abe.2018.31)) that considers both the terrain of the river valley and the configuration of the urban fabric, as shown in the diagram below.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.alt='Diagram of the method of delineation', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/delineation.jpg")
```

The method consists of three steps, each explained on this website in a separate article:

1. The **corridor boundary** of the urban area surrounding the river is delineated on the street network considering a given **walkshed** (the urban area reached along the street network within a given walking distance from the river, 500m by default) and the **valley edge** derived from a Digital Elevation Model, as shown in `vignette("corridor-delineation")`.  

2. The delineated corridor is divided into **corridor segments** bounded by the main transversal streets, as shown in `vignette("corridor-segmentation")`.  

3. The **river space**, i.e., the space between the river and the first line of buildings is determined, as shown in `vignette("riverspace-delineation")`.
