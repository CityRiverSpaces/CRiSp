For a more detailed analysis of an urban river corridor, corridor-level delineation may not be sufficient. The corridor needs to be subdivided into smaller morphological units. Segmentation is a process of subdividing the corridor by using major transversal road or rail infrastructure lines.

By default, the all-in-one function `delineate_corridor()` includes the division of the corridor into segments. It is also possible to use the `delineate_segment()` function to divide the corridor in a separate step.

To demonstrate this as a separate step, we will use the `bucharest$corridor` and `bucharest$streets` layers from the package data as input.

```{r eval=FALSE}
segmented_corridor <- delineate_segments(bucharest$corridor, bucharest$streets)
```
