## Introduction

In this article we explore how to delineate a study area around a point of interest (POI) using Bucharest as the study area. We choose a location along the River Dâmbovița. The POI is represented as a point in the WGS84 coordinate reference system.

```{r}
poi <- st_sfc(st_point(c(26.074123, 44.432875)), crs = 4326)
```

The `delineate_segment()` takes the POI as input. By default, it tries to identify the city and the river closest to it. If no river is found, it will return an error message.

```{r}
segment_poi <- delineate_segment(poi)
```
